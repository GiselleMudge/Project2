### Overview

Access here -->  http://project2jems.herokuapp.com/

The BucketList app allows you to keep track of the more important goals in life before life passes you by. It is easy to make a long term list of dreams, but when life gets too busy these goals are also easy to forget about. Let others know what you're up to. Get inspiration from other dreamers, affirmative comments from friends old and new. Who knows, you may meet others who want to achieve the same goals as you do. Find a new squad to crush those goals!
